## What's this?
Algorithm/data structure experiments in Clojure.

## Disclaimer
* I'm a newbie in Clojure. The code is a non-idiomatic mess with wrong abstractions and strange behaviour in edge cases. For example, some of the generators choke with stack overflows when more than a few thousand elements are realized.
* The implementations are far from optimal. Performance is not among my goals for now.

## Why "venice"
I don't know. It's a random name.
