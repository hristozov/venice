[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hristozov/venice.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hristozov/venice)

## What's this?
Algorithm/data structure experiments in Clojure.

## Disclaimer
* I'm a newbie in Clojure. The code is a non-idiomatic mess with wrong abstractions and strange behaviour in edge cases.
* The implementations are far from optimal. Performance is not among my goals for now.

## Why "venice"
I don't know. It's a random name.
